# BookSearch

by Lauren Rowe

## Description

This was an application that allowed users to search for books from the Google Books API through a RESTful API, but I have refactored it to use a GraphQL API with an Apollo Server instead.

## Installation

Application can be used right from the deployed link.  No installation required.
